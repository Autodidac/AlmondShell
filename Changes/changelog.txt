# Changelog

## [v0.71.0]
- Adopted the C++23 module toolchain and documented the migration steps (fresh build trees, module-aware CMake configuration,
  and compiler requirements) so downstream packagers can rebuild AlmondShell with BMI-aware generators.
- Raised the documented prerequisites to C++23-era compilers and CMake releases with module scanning enabled, refreshing the
  README, configuration guide, and engine analysis to align with the v0.71.0 snapshot.

## [v0.70.3]
- Re-synchronised every build entry point (CMake, shell scripts, VS Code tasks) to link against the standalone glad loader so Linux targets resolve `gladLoadGLLoader` without bespoke flags.
- Bumped the engine metadata and documentation (README snapshot, engine analysis, and configuration guide) to v0.70.3 so diagnostics, launcher manifests, and downstream packagers advertise the correct version in lockstep with the release.

## [v0.70.2]
- Eliminated duplicate glad symbol definitions when bundling both the Raylib loader and standalone artefacts, tightening the default linkage rules.
- Relaxed the CMake option flow so distributors can toggle glad packaging without tripping Raylib's built-in loader assumptions, and bumped metadata to v0.70.2.

## [v0.70.1]
- Fixed Linux builds by always linking the glad OpenGL loader so `gladLoadGLLoader` resolves even when Raylib is active.
- Documented the new build workflow, refreshed the Linux quickstart instructions, and bumped engine metadata to v0.70.1.

## [v0.59.11]
- Expanded the immediate-mode GUI with image buttons, editable text fields, multiline text boxes, and a ready-made console window helper while plumbing keyboard/text input through `agui`'s event queue.

## [v0.59.10]
- Added `agui.hpp` as the shared immediate-mode GUI layer, generating a built-in font atlas and wiring Raylib + SDL3 draw paths so every backend can render consistent windows, labels, and buttons without bespoke setup.

## [v0.59.9]
- Normalised Raylib GUI scaling when panes dock or undock by tracking logical window dimensions separately from framebuffer sizes, keeping buttons consistent during DPI-aware resizes.

## [v0.59.8]
- Removed the extra placeholder Win32 shells after SDL3 and Raylib contexts hand back their native window handles, so the multiplexer now docks the real backends without spawning blank white host panes.
- Scaled Raylib sprites and mouse input from the live framebuffer ratio, keeping menu buttons proportional as windows grow instead of shrinking against the viewport.

## [v0.59.7]
- Enabled Raylib HiDPI windowing by setting the high-DPI flag, mirroring framebuffer dimensions into context state, and rescaling mouse input so docked overlays stay pixel-correct on scaled displays.
- Synced post-docking framebuffer sizes into resize dispatch to stop multi-monitor layouts from inheriting stale logical dimensions when native scaling changes mid-session.

## [v0.59.6]
- Prevented Raylib UI elements from shrinking when windows scale beyond their backing framebuffer by skipping downscaling passes and only applying HiDPI growth, keeping docked buttons readable at any size.

## [v0.59.5]
- Normalised Raylib child window resizing so docked panes keep the same scale as they move between parents, preventing UI shrinking or collapsing during docking transitions.

## [v0.59.4]
- Reattached the docking subclass hook when SDL3 and Raylib backends create child windows so docked panes drag and resize correctly again.
- Normalised Raylib sprite coordinates to account for render-to-screen DPI scaling, preventing menu buttons from shrinking as windows scale up.

## [v0.59.3]
- Fixed the Windows build by persisting each window's narrow title in the multiplexer so SDL and Raylib backends receive the pane label during initialisation.
- Documented the regression fix in the engine analysis and roadmap, and bumped the engine version metadata.

## [v0.59.2]
- Fixed SDL3 initialisation by correcting the success check and avoiding bogus error throws, so docked SDL contexts spawn again.
- Removed references to the deprecated Win32 parent property path for SDL3 and tightened the embedding flow around native parenting.
- Added backend labels to every docked window, threading them through to SDL and Raylib so each renderer advertises its pane title.
- Documented the docking label update and bumped the engine version helpers.

## [v0.59.1]
- Coalesced Raylib window resize notifications so engine contexts and client callbacks stay in sync with OS window dimensions without recursive loops.
- Updated the roadmap and engine analysis documentation to capture the Raylib backend stability work.

## [v0.59.0]
- Restricted the Win32 multi-context manager implementation and threading hooks to Windows builds while providing a no-op stub for other platforms, unblocking POSIX consumers.
- Replaced the unconditional `<windows.h>` include in `awindowdata.hpp` with lightweight handle aliases so cross-platform and headless tooling builds avoid Win32 dependency errors.

## [v0.58.3]
- Hooked the shared runtime loop into `RunEngine()` and `wWinMain` so non-updater entry points launch the full multi-context
  manager instead of returning immediately.
- Refactored the Windows engine bootstrap to reuse the same helper from both entry paths, keeping renderer lifecycle and scene
  selection logic in one place.

## [v0.58.2]
- Made `GetEngineVersion()` thread-safe by switching to a `thread_local` buffer and exposing helper views for tooling.
- Sourced updater configuration version strings from the engine's version helpers and taught the updater to fall back to `aversion.hpp` when parsing remote releases.
- Documented supported `aengineconfig.hpp` flag combinations for multi-backend builds.

## [v0.58.0]
- Added `ScriptLoadReport` diagnostics so script reload failures surface actionable messaging and status flags.
- Made script reload scheduling synchronous via `WaitAll()` with finished-node pruning to avoid dangling coroutines.
- Cleaned up coroutine handles after execution to prevent leaked frames in the task graph worker pool.
- Updated roadmap and engine analysis documentation to reflect the hardened hot-reload workflow.

## [v0.57.16]
- Prevented `ProcessAllContexts` from re-entering contexts already driven by render threads, eliminating a crash-prone race in the multi-context manager.
- Marked the roadmap milestone for hardened multi-context management with notes on the concurrency fix.
