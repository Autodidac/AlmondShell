# Legacy Menu Atlas Assets

These textures were previously sliced into the main menu sprite atlas. The menu overlay now renders through the immediate-mode GUI layer, so the files are retained here only for historical reference. They can be deleted in downstream projects that no longer rely on the atlas importer.
